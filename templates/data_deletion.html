    <h1>Data Deletion Instructions</h1>
    <p>
        If you are an Instagram user who has messaged <em>@himanistanbul</em> and wish to have your message data deleted
        from our systems, please send an email to <a href="mailto:privacy@hi-man.com.tr">privacy@hi-man.com.tr</a> with
        the subject “Instagram Data Deletion Request”. Include your Instagram handle and the approximate date of the
        conversation. We will verify ownership and delete the data we control, subject to legal retention requirements.
    </p>

    <p>
        You may also delete messages directly within Instagram; however, server-side copies required for business records
        may persist until processed through the request workflow above.
